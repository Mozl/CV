I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for cutting edge technology and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I have a particular interest in bots and automation. I am studying at Makers Academy, an intensive coding bootcamp in London, growing not just my technical skills, but also my teamwork and communication skills. I am looking for a full stack or front-end role where I can apply and grow my skillset while having fun with my team.

## Experience

#### Student at [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/)

At Makers I learned a mix of technical and soft skills. My work has mainly centred around Ruby and Javascript projects, moving from simple CLI apps to full stack apps hosted on Heroku. At every step I have focused on TDD and XP values, ensuring I maintain high code quality and work seamlessly with other people. When working in a team I ensured we employed the Agile methodology for rapid continuous improvement.

Key skills: software craftsmanship, communication, problem solving, fast learning

#### Digital Marketing Executive at [Pulsar](https://www.pulsarplatform.com/)

As one half of the marketing department, I was responsible for the successful running of marketing operations such as Google AdWords and Display ads, content creation and managing Hubspot CRM. This included building bespoke, targeted landing pages and creating Pulsar's first email automation function. I was always working towards leads and revenue targets, generating more than £125k from Google advertising alone.

**Key transferrable skills:** Teamwork, stakeholder and dev team management

#### Paid Search Account Executive at [Neo@Ogilvy](https://www.neoogilvy.co.uk/)

Working on a major accounting software company client, I was responsible for the daily budget management and optimisation of a £15 million Google AdWords account. This involved data analysis, DoubleClick floodlight tag management and campaign strategy. I formed a strong relationship with my clients, ensuring good communication and providing in-depth reports on campaign performance.

**Key transferrable skills:** data analysis, client relationship management, communication
