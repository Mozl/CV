### Get in touch

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmoselhi/"><img src="logos/linkedin.png" width="50"></a>

I am a front-end React developer with a passion for React, Javascript and new tech. My programming skills are strengthened with the relationship management and business skills I gained in previous roles. I am looking for a permanent position in an innovative London-based company where I can grow my React/Redux skills and make cool stuff with cool people.

## Experience

#### Software Engineer at [British Pearl](https://www.britishpearl.com/)

Working on the frontend team I was working on building the brand new resale market side of the property investment platform, as well as creating the new version of the website. This involved using React and Redux, alongside tech such as ImmutableJS and Jenkins. Testing was an important part of my work, using Jest and Enzyme for unit testing and Nightwatch for E2E testing. The role was centred around Agile practices such as sprints, standups and the Jira kanban.

#### Student at [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/)

At Makers I learned a mix of technical and soft skills. My work has mainly centred around Ruby and Javascript projects, moving from simple CLI apps to full stack apps hosted on Heroku. At every step I have focused on TDD and XP values, ensuring I maintain high code quality and work seamlessly with other people. When working in a team I ensured we employed the Agile methodology for rapid continuous improvement.

Key skills: software craftsmanship, communication, problem solving, fast learning

#### Digital Marketing Executive at [Pulsar](https://www.pulsarplatform.com/)

As one half of the marketing department, I was responsible for the successful running of marketing operations such as Google AdWords and Display ads, content creation and managing Hubspot CRM. This included building bespoke, targeted landing pages and creating Pulsar's first email automation function. I was always working towards leads and revenue targets, generating more than £125k from Google advertising alone.

**Key transferrable skills:** Teamwork, stakeholder and dev team management

#### Paid Search Account Executive at [Neo@Ogilvy](https://www.neoogilvy.co.uk/)

Working on a major accounting software company client, I was responsible for the daily budget management and optimisation of a £15 million Google AdWords account. This involved data analysis, DoubleClick floodlight tag management and campaign strategy. I formed a strong relationship with my clients, ensuring good communication and providing in-depth reports on campaign performance.

**Key transferrable skills:** data analysis, client relationship management, communication
